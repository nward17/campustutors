# CampusTutors

CampusTutors is a tutoring application that I have created for my capstone project at the University of Maine. CampusTutors is what
I like to call 'The Uber of Tutoring'. Essentially, it is an on-demand application for students of a university to request a tutor
for help on a particular course or subject. CampusTutors is a functioning web application that will work on any device. It also
exists as a native Android application as well where it utilizes push notifications.
